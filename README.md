Calculate de cheksu, of a matrix.
Given the following spreadsheet:
* 5 1 9 5
* 7 5 3
* 2 4 6 8

The first row's largest and smallest values are 9 and 1, and their difference is 8.
The second row's largest and smallest values are 7 and 3, and their difference is 4.
The third row's difference is 6.

In this example, the spreadsheet's checksum would be 8 + 4 + 6 = 18.
